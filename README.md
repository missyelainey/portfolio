# üë©üèª About Me
Hello there!

I'm Elaine Cristel Elleazar, but you can call me Elainey. I'm a Software QA Engineer with almost 3 years in the digital trenches (yup!), making sure software isn't just "good enough," but genuinely reliable and a joy for users.

Think of me as your software's personal detective. I've got a sharp eye for detail and an unshakeable commitment to quality. I thrive on carefully finding inconsistencies and ensuring precision, turning complex challenges into polished, high-quality products. I'm also a firm believer that great software is a team sport, and I love collaborating to nail those excellent outcomes.

So, here's the honest truth: Your software's true potential isn't unlocked until its QA Engineer (that's me!) gives the final, confident thumbs up. And yes, I'll probably still spot that _one_ tiny thing before launch‚Äîbecause that's what makes it perfect.


# üõ†Ô∏è My Skills: A Deep Dive into My QA Toolkit & Expertise
This section outlines the core skills and tools I wield to ensure software quality, precision, and performance.

## üî¨ Testing Methodologies & Expertise
My approach to quality assurance is rooted in a comprehensive understanding of various testing methodologies, ensuring every angle is covered for robust software delivery.
* **Manual Testing:** Meticulously executing test cases to identify defects and validate functionality from a user's perspective.
* **Regression Testing:** Ensuring new code changes don't negatively impact existing functionalities.
* **Functional Testing:** Verifying that all software features operate exactly as intended.
* **API Testing:** Directly testing the interfaces that allow different software components to communicate, ensuring seamless integration and data flow.
* **Smoke Testing:** Performing quick, high-level tests to ensure the most critical functions are stable before deeper testing begins.
* **Black Box Testing:** Evaluating software functionality without knowledge of its internal structure, focusing purely on user interactions and outputs.

## üíª Tools & Technologies
I leverage a powerful suite of industry-standard tools to streamline testing processes, manage defects, and collaborate effectively.

### Advanced Proficiency:
* **Canva:** Skilled in graphic design for creating compelling reports, visualizations, and presentations.
* **MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems):** Expertise in QA within manufacturing execution environments.
* **Microsoft Office Suite:** Proficient in Word (for creating and reviewing documents), Excel (for test plans, cases, scenarios, and reports), and PowerPoint (for reporting, visualization, and presentations).
### Proficient:
* **Confluence:** Utilizing Confluence for documentation, knowledge sharing, and test plan collaboration.
* **Jira:** Extensive use of Jira for agile project management, defect tracking, and workflow management.
* **PL/SQL:** Proficiency in database interaction and validation for data integrity and backend testing.
* **Postman:** Skillful in using Postman for API testing, validating endpoints, and automating API test collections.
* **Ranorex:** Experience with this automation tool for robust and repeatable UI and functional tests.
* **ServiceNow:** Experience with ITSM platforms for incident management, service delivery, and potentially workflow testing.
### Basic Knowledge:
* **Lucidchart:** Skilled in creating professional flowcharts and diagrams for process mapping and technical documentation.
* **Power BI:** Basic familiarity with Power BI for data visualization and business intelligence reporting.
* **Selenium:** Familiarity with using Selenium for web application testing automation.
